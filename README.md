## Stage 1 - Docker image preparation
This stage describes the process of building the performance_test image for 5G-ERA that is originally created by ApexAI. 

There are 2 ways of building the image. The first one is to execute the command that will automate the steps required.

```shell
$ ./performance_image/build.sh
```
The script in the `performance_image` folder clones the ApexAI performance test repository, checks out to the correct branch and builds the specified `dockerfile` with the image.

After executing the `build.sh` command see the available images in the docker.

```shell
$ docker image ls
```
